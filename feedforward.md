In the consult of Database we talked about how to store the names of the music and authors. Frederik said the nice option is a csv file for names of the songs and authors. And for nice to have mp3 music it is okay to use folders.
In the consult of maker part I was suggested by Tijn to use a plywood 5mm thin and metal connections for the box.
In the consult of Python and AI Marie told me to make 2 models, first for face recognition and then only for emotion detection.
